Description: Monkey patches magrittr so that recursive objects are introspected.
    It provides '%>%' accessors for S3, S4, R6, proto objects.
    That is, iris %>% Sepal.Length finds 'Sepal.Length' within the object. A
    replacement method is also provided so that iris %>% Sepal.Length <- x also
    works.
