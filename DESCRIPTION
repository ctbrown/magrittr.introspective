Description: This packages provides a monkey patch for 'magrittr' so that
    elements/attributes of recursive objects 
    (e.g. lists, data.frames, S3, S4, R6, env, etc,) can be accessed using only 
    the pipe '%>%' operator and their names. That is, 'magrittr.plus' looks for 
    the RHS of the pipe *within* the LHS before looking in the enclosing scope. 
    This enhancement eliminates the need for `.$` or `extract[2]` and is more 
    in keeping with the tidyverse that favors "Data First, Context Next" 
    evaluation.  Additionally, it promotes more concise and legible code. 
    Additionally, replacement methods also allows for inline replacement of a 
    recursive objects elements/attributes: 'LHS %>% RHS <- newvalue'
